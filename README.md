# Control-Structures-in-Python
Of course! Here's a **simple version** of the **functionality** for both programs, explained separately:

---

## ✅ **1. Even or Odd Number Checker**

### 🧾 **Program:**

```python
a = int(input("Enter a Number: "))

if (a % 2 == 0):
    print(a, "is an Even Number")
else:
    print(a, "is an Odd Number")


### 💡 **Simple Functionality:**

* This program asks the user to enter a number.
* It checks if the number can be divided by 2.
* If yes, it prints “Even Number”.
* If not, it prints “Odd Number”.

## ✅ **2. Sum of Numbers from 1 to 50**

### 🧾 **Program:**


```python
sum = 0
for i in range(1, 51):
    sum += i

print("The sum of numbers from 1 to 50 is", sum)
```

### 💡 **Simple Functionality:**

* This program adds all numbers from 1 to 50.
* It uses a loop to keep adding each number.
* At the end, it prints the total sum.
